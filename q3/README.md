# Issues with original code:

## 1. Inefficient Use of useMemo:
- The useMemo hook is used for sortedBalances, but the dependency list includes prices, which isn't actually used 
in the filtering or sorting logic. This causes unnecessary recomputations whenever prices changes.

## 2. Poor Filtering Logic:
The filter logic in sortedBalances is incorrect and verbose:
- lhsPriority is referenced but not defined, leading to an error.
- The filter returns balances with amount <= 0, which may not align with the intended logic.
- Returning true for negative balances seems counterintuitive.

## 3. Sorting Complexity:
- The sorting operation calls getPriority multiple times for each comparison, which is redundant and inefficient.

## 4. Incorrect Type Handling:
- balance.blockchain is used without proper type checks or inference for its type.
- sortedBalances is assumed to contain FormattedWalletBalance but actually holds WalletBalance. This can lead to runtime issues.

## 5. Inefficient .map Chaining:
- formattedBalances performs an additional .map on sortedBalances, which could be combined into the earlier filter/sort chain.

## 6. Using index as a Key in JSX:
- Using the index as a key in WalletRow is an anti-pattern, as it can cause rendering issues when the list changes.

## 7. Unused Props:
- The children prop from props is destructured but never used.

## 8. Lack of Constants for Priorities:
- The getPriority function uses hardcoded priority values, which should be extracted into constants for better maintainability.
